# The Cloud Functions for Firebase Event Providers
Check out [the Cloud Functions for Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) for information on how to use the APIs in these packages.

### The `datastore` provider
The Datastore integration is in early preview, and not yet publicly usable.
If you'd like to request early access to use this integration, [please fill out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/6T2kHu7n4N5IB7Ya2).

Since this is a preview feature, any new version may introduce breaking changes.
It is recommended that you depend on a specific version of the firebase-functions SDK
in your project's functions/package.json.
