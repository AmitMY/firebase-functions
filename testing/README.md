### Cloud Functions for Firebase testing utilities

This module is the access point for testing-only utilities for Cloud Functions
for Firebase. We discourage relying on code in this module for your production
application, but encourage using the utilities found here to write effective
unit tests.

This testing module can be accessed with the following import:

`import * as testing from 'firebase-functions/testing';`

TODO(rjh): document testing utilities included here.
